This is just a simple project to demostrate encapsulation and polymorphism, I didn't want to create a complex/big project to confuse ourselves.

I am requesting you to think how the project can be modified to align with encapsulation and polymorphism, so below are the tasks

Task 1: 

Think how the classes can be encapsulated better and modify the classes. 

Below are some thoughts
1. Are the classes exposing too many details than what is needed? 
2. Are the classes exposing too less details than what is needed?


Task 2:

Think how the project can be modified to be polymorphic and the advantages of introducing polymorphism

Below are some thoughts:
1. With the current design, what are all the changes needed if we need to add "Angular" developer interview result to the project?
2. With the current design, what are all the changes needed if we need to add additional requirments for hiring developers?
3. How the above mentioned challenges/changes can be simplified by introducing polymorphism?

Feel free to be creative :-) I will upload/share my version with polymorphism on the day we will meet for Q & A.
